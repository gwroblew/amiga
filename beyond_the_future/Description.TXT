Some infos to the source:

- 'atom.d' is main source of the demo
- use my Asm-One.pref (or you will get some warnings or troubles)
- define 'ondisk' if you create final version (for testing don't define it)
- i didn't save *.ilbm files (logos, credits, usw.) so you have to remove
  from source everything what uses them
- *.cmtext files are Crunchmania crunched files *.text (textures)
- 'getback.s' , 'gettext.s' converts TARGA pictures to my own format
  *.back - backgrounds; *.text - textures
- 'getanim.s' is simplified anim cruncher and converter
- 'getmusic.s' is simplified vector quantizer for music modules
- i don't need to describe commands of my vector-language when you've
  got so many examples
- the *.obj file format (objects) is also not very complicated
- hope i didn't forget to save any important file
- be carefull! there are still bugs in this vector routine!
  (try to remove them (he!,he!))
